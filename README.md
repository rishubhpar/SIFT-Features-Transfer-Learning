# SIFT-Features-Transfer-Learning
This repo will have implementation of SIFT scale space extrema estimation and the transfer learning with VGG network



Instructions:

% 1. To run the sift module call "python3 sift_feats.py"
% 2. To run the knn module call "python3 knn.py"
% 3. To run the VGG16 classifier and the custom model run "python3 model_cnn_ft.py"
